# ToolpathGenerator v1.0(Beta)
Automating Toolpath Generation of 3D objects for 3-Axis CNC 

ToolpathGenerator automates toolpath planing process involved in toolpath generation of 3D objects for 3-Axis CNC. This work seeks to reduce the barrier faced by the entry level makers and designers involved in CNC machining. 

## Usage
### Dependancies
The voxelizer built into the system requires [boost library for c+](www.boost.org) to compile. Please note that, the [cvmlcpp library](http://tech.unige.ch/cvmlcpp/) and [omptl library](http://tech.unige.ch/omptl/) has been modified and integrated into the source code.

The voxelizer currently is known not to work on Mac, windows remains to be tested.

### Compiling
#### Stand-alone Voxelizer
If you wish to only voxelize the stl file without generating toolpaths, you need to compile as:
```
>g++ -std=c++11 ./src/standalone_voxelizer.cpp -o standalone_voxelizer
```
#### ToolpathGenerator without Voxelizer
To run ToolpathGenerator without voxelizing, compile:
```
>g++ -std=c++11 ./src/run_without_voxelizer.cpp -o run_without_voxelizer
```
#### ToolpathGenerator with Voxelizer
To run ToolpathGenerator with voxelizer, compile:
```
>g++ -std=c++11 ./src/run_with_voxelizer.cpp -o run_with_voxelizer
```

### Executing
#### Stand-alone Voxelizer
Standalone voxelizer gives choice of input and output through parameters:

##### Input

```
"File" :  Input as a file address

"String" : Input as ASCII STL string through stdin
```

##### Output
```
"JSON" : Output as JSON

"String" : Output as string of 0s and 1s
```

Execute Standalone Voxelizer as:
```
>./standalone_voxelizer [input parameter] [output parameter] {input file address if file} [output file address] {< input string if string}
```

#### ToolpathGenerator without Voxelizer
ToolpathGenerator without Voxelizer is run as:
```
>./run_without_voxelizer [output location] < [input voxel file]
```

#### ToolpathGenerator without Voxelizer
ToolpathGenerator without Voxelizer is run as:
```
>./run_with_voxelizer [input voxel file] [output location]
```
